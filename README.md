# Setup Cargo Lambda

This GitHub action downloads, extracts and adds the [cargo-lambda](https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda) binary to the workspace PATH.

Prior installation of Rust, Cargo and Zig are required within the workflow.

They can be installed using the [rustup-toolchain-install](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rustup-toolchain-install) and [setup-zig](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-zig) GitHub actions as shown below:

## Usage

```yaml
name: cargo-lambda-test

jobs:
  cargo-lambda-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
